# Flood-Prediction-using-AI-and-EDA-approach
This project uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to predict flood occurrence, severity, and timing based on environmental data such as rainfall, river discharge, and soil moisture. Through exploratory data analysis and model evaluation, it aims to improve disaster preparedness and support real-time decision-making.
